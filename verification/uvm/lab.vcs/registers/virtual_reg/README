      Title:   RAL virtual register example using UVM
      Objective: This example shows the modeling of virtual registers within a memory block in RAL. It illustrates the integration of this model into a verification environment and shows how a user can create sequences to access these virtual registers using the register model.      
      Description:    Please refer to the RAL Primer in $VCS_HOME/doc/UserGuide
      Additional setup: None   
 
 To run the example:
     Using Makefile:
       clean          -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       comp           -- To compile the design
       run            -- To run the design
       all            -- It does all the above steps.

     Using shell scripts:
       clean.csh      -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       comp.csh       -- To compile the design
       run.csh        -- To run the design
